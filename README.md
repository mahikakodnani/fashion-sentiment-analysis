# Fashion Sentiment Analysis: E-Commerce Customer Insights

### Project Overview
As part of my Tech journey at NMIMS, I developed this custom Machine Learning pipeline to bridge the gap between unstructured customer feedback and actionable business strategy. 

### Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **ML Library:** Scikit-Learn (Logistic Regression)
* **NLP Techniques:** TF-IDF Vectorization, N-grams (Unigrams & Bigrams)
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn

### Key Results
* **Accuracy:** 92.7% on test data.
* **Business Insight:** Identified that "fabric quality" and "sizing" were the primary drivers for negative reviews, allowing for targeted supply chain improvements.

### How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Open `fashion_sentiment_analysis (1).ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
